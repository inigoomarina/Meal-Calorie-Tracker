# Meal Calorie Tracker

**Project Overview:**

This web application allows users to track their daily meal intake and monitor calorie consumption against personal goals. It features user registration/login, meal logging (including fetching nutritional data from an external source - *implied, confirm if FoodData Central is used*), viewing meal history, and setting daily calorie targets.

The application is built with the MERN stack:
*   **Frontend:** React (using Vite)
*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js:** (Includes npm) Required for running both the backend and frontend. Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used to store user and meal data. You can:
    *   Install it locally: [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
    *   Or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas: [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to get the application running locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    # Replace <your-repository-url> with the actual URL if applicable
    git clone <your-repository-url> 
    cd meal-calorie-tracker 
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend (Server):**
    *   Navigate to the server directory:
        ```bash
        cd server
        ```
    *   Install backend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create a configuration file named `.env` in the `server` directory (`meal-calorie-tracker/server/.env`). This file stores environment-specific variables. Add the following content, replacing the placeholder values with your actual configuration:
        ```env
        # MongoDB Connection String (replace with your local or Atlas URI)
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string 

        # Port the backend server will run on (default is 5000)
        PORT=5000 

        # Secret key for signing JWT tokens (choose a strong, random string)
        JWT_SECRET=your_very_secure_jwt_secret_key 

        # How long JWT tokens remain valid (e.g., 1h, 7d, 30d)
        JWT_EXPIRE=30d 
        ```
        *   `MONGO_URI`: Your connection string for MongoDB.
        *   `PORT`: The port the backend server will listen on.
        *   `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key used for securing user sessions. Make this long and random.
        *   `JWT_EXPIRE`: The duration for which a login session is valid.

3.  **Set up the Frontend (Client):**
    *   Navigate to the client directory from the project root:
        ```bash
        # If you are in the 'server' directory:
        cd ../client 
        # If you are in the 'meal-calorie-tracker' root directory:
        cd client
        ```
    *   Install frontend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   **(Optional) Environment Variables for Client:** If the client needs to know the backend API URL (especially if it's not running on the default `http://localhost:5000`), you might need a `.env` file in the `client` directory (`meal-calorie-tracker/client/.env`). Check the client-side code (e.g., `axios.js` or service files) for how the API base URL is determined. If needed, create the file with:
        ```env
        VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000 
        # Replace 5000 if your backend runs on a different port
        ```
        *(Note: Vite requires environment variables exposed to the client to be prefixed with `VITE_`)*

## Running the Application

The backend server and the frontend development server need to be run separately, typically in two different terminal windows.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    *   Open a terminal window.
    *   Navigate to the `server` directory (`meal-calorie-tracker/server`).
    *   Run the start command (check `server/package.json` for the exact script, common options are):
        ```bash
        npm start 
        # or
        npm run dev # If nodemon or similar is configured for development
        ```
    *   The server should start, usually logging a message like "Server running on port 5000".

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    *   Open a *second* terminal window.
    *   Navigate to the `client` directory (`meal-calorie-tracker/client`).
    *   Run the development server command:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   Vite will compile the frontend and provide a URL (usually `http://localhost:5173` or similar) to access the application in your web browser.

3.  **Access the Application:**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by the frontend development server (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
