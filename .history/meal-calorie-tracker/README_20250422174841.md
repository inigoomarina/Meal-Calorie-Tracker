# Meal Calorie Tracker

This project is a web application for tracking meal calories. It consists of a Node.js/Express backend and a React frontend.

## Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
*   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (or a MongoDB Atlas account)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd meal-calorie-tracker
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend (Server):**
    *   Navigate to the server directory:
        ```bash
        cd server
        ```
    *   **Important:** Ensure a `package.json` file exists in this directory. If not, you might be in the wrong folder or the project setup is incomplete.
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory (`meal-calorie-tracker/server/.env`) with the following content, replacing placeholder values:
        ```env
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        PORT=5000
        JWT_SECRET=your_very_secure_jwt_secret_key
        JWT_EXPIRE=30d # e.g., token expiry time like 30d, 1h
        ```
    *   Install server dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend (Client):**
    *   Navigate to the client directory from the project root:
        ```bash
        cd ../client 
        # Or from the server directory: cd ../client
        ```
    *   Install client dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

## Running the Application

You need to run both the server and the client simultaneously.
